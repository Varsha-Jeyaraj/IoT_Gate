# IoT_Gate

### Introduction: 
This project involves an IoT-based gate control system designed for security zones, residential apartments, and other restricted areas. The system ensures that only authorized vehicles are granted entry for parking, leveraging a combination of vehicle ID and a unique access ID for enhanced security. Additionally, sensor proximity ensures that only vehicles near the gate can trigger it. The system can be extended to a toll gate for highways or public parking areas.


### Objective:
To develop an IoT-based vehicle entry system that ensures authorized access with,
  - Contactless Operation: Enables seamless and secure vehicle entry without physical interaction. 
  - Low-Cost Implementation: Achieved through the use of affordable components and reduced hardware requirements by using existing mobile devices for ID validation. 
  - User-Friendly Design: Simplified processes for users, including intuitive mobile app integration for vehicle verification. 
  - Scalability: Adaptable for use in various settings, from small residential apartments to large high-security zones or toll gates.
